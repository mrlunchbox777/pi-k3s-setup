# pi-k3s-setup

## Issues

* k3sup join seems to be completing successfully, but it's not quite working

## Improvements

* allow different pi user and different password
* allow use of only ssh keys
* update variable names
* split into multiple scripts
* rename runme
* rename repo
* allow different target ssh user and key 
* allow different cluster ssh user and key
