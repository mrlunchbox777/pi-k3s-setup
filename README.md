# pi-k3s-setup

They keys and .kube/config end up in the .docker-data folder. You will need to update the .kube/config to use the right hostname.

## Issues

* No issues creating the cluster at this point, but lots of improvements

## Improvements

* update variable names
* split into multiple scripts
* rewrite how the .kube/config gets updated, update the docs and show help as well
* rename runme
* rename repo
